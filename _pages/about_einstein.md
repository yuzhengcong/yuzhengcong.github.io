Hi, This is Yuzheng Cong. I am a new-graduate Machine Learning Engineer with a systems-oriented background in large-scale model inference and ML infrastructure. I hold a Master’s degree in Information Science from Cornell University and a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

My experience centers on building and optimizing the end-to-end pipeline for machine learning models, from model loading and scheduling to high-performance inference. I have worked on system-level problems such as GPU execution efficiency, parallelism strategies, and memory management for modern models, including large language models. I am particularly interested in inference optimization, KV cache management, and the design of scalable ML serving systems.

Through research projects, internships, and engineering work, I have developed a strong foundation in ML systems, distributed systems, and low-level performance optimization. I enjoy working close to the runtime and hardware stack to translate model improvements into measurable system gains. I am currently seeking full-time Machine Learning Engineer roles where I can apply this background to real-world, large-scale ML systems.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
