Hi, This is Yuzheng Cong. I am a new-graduate Machine Learning Engineer I hold a Master’s degree in **Information Science from Cornell University** and a **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**.

My experience centers on building and optimizing the end-to-end pipeline for machine learning models, from model loading and scheduling to high-performance inference. I have worked on system-level problems such as GPU execution efficiency, parallelism strategies, and memory management for modern models, including large language models. I am particularly interested in inference optimization, KV cache management, and the design of scalable ML serving systems.

Through research projects, internships, and engineering work, I have developed a strong foundation in ML systems, distributed systems, and low-level performance optimization. I enjoy working close to the runtime and hardware stack to translate model improvements into measurable system gains. I am currently seeking full-time Machine Learning Engineer roles where I can apply this background to real-world, large-scale ML systems.
